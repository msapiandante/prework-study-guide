## Boot Camp Prework Study Guide for Students

I wanted to learn new information and skills that would prepare me for coding bootcamp. I built this project to start to develop new skills while also provide a framework to study necessary information to take away from the pre-work. I learned how to utilize the three program languages to create a website: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also learned how to use git, git bash, VS code and stack overflow. 

## Credits

Shout out to my mother Lani, mother in law Mayette, partner Kristin and my cats Pascal and Sammy in offering me SO much support as I change career paths and learn new skills.
