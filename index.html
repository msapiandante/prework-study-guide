        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> HTML is used to create structure of a webpage.</li>
          <li> HTML stands for hypertext markup language language.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li> An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets</li>
          <li> The a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link. </li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users. </li>
       <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization.</li>
       <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
       <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
       <li>most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet</li>
       <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. For example, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue.</li>
       <li> Just because files are in the same project repository doesn’t mean they know about each other. External CSS style sheet needs to connected to HTML. To do this- use the HTML link element.</li>
       <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue. We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>Version control is the practice of tracking changes to our code.</li>
          <li>git revert: use this command along with first seven characters of SHA to use version control.</li>
          <li>An SHA, or hash, is actually a long string of numbers or letters,developers often type out only the first seven numbers or letters</li>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
          <li>Github is cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely.</li>
          <li>Markdown is a lightweight plain-text formatting language. Working in a Markdown file is similar to working with a .doc, except we have to use special syntax for formatting.</li>
          <li>Github offers a task management tool called GitHub issues, which gives developers and teams an easy way to keep track of key tasks and progress.</li>
          <li>Developers use repositories, commonly known as repos, as folders to store: 1. Files that contain code. 2. Files that contain other information about the code, like a README file. 3. The version history for all of the files in the repository.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is case sensitive.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as comments. You can write comments in JavaScript just as you can in CSS</li>
          <li>/*
            Everything in between is a comment.
            */
            Copy to Clipboard
            If your comment contains no line breaks, it's an option to put it behind two slashes like this:
            // This is a comment</li>
           <li>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables). For example: A + B.</li>
           <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement. </li>
           <li>A function is a code snippet that can be called by other code or by itself, or a variable that refers to the function.</li>
           <li>When a function is called, arguments are passed to the function as input, and the function can optionally return a value. </li>
           <li>A function in JavaScript is also an object.</li>
           <li>Real interactivity on a website requires event handlers. These are code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response. </li>
           <li>Once a JavaScript string is created, it is not possible to modify it.</li>
           <li>When the computer encounters an if statement in a JavaScript file, it will check to see if the condition that we provide is truthy. If it is, then it will do whatever action we ask it to do in between the curly brackets. If the condition isn’t true or has a value that isn’t truthy, then the computer will ignore whatever is in between the curly brackets and move on.</li>
           <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
           <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
           <li>A for loop contains three important statements: starting point for loop, condition, and a final statement (this is what allows the array to iterate over each item).</li>
           <li>JavaScript is an OOP (object-oriented programming) language. </li>
