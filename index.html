        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> HTML is used to create structure of a webpage.</li>
          <li> HTML stands for hypertext markup language language.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li> An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets</li>
          <li> The a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link. </li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users. </li>
       <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization.</li>
       <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
       <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
       <li>most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet</li>
       <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. For example, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue.</li>
       <li> Just because files are in the same project repository doesn’t mean they know about each other. External CSS style sheet needs to connected to HTML. To do this- use the HTML link element.</li>
       <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue. We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>Version control is the practice of tracking changes to our code.</li>
          <li>git revert: use this command along with first seven characters of SHA to use version control.</li>
          <li>An SHA, or hash, is actually a long string of numbers or letters,developers often type out only the first seven numbers or letters</li>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
          <li>Github is cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely.</li>
          <li>Markdown is a lightweight plain-text formatting language. Working in a Markdown file is similar to working with a .doc, except we have to use special syntax for formatting.</li>
          <li>Github offers a task management tool called GitHub issues, which gives developers and teams an easy way to keep track of key tasks and progress.</li>
          <li>Developers use repositories, commonly known as repos, as folders to store: 1. Files that contain code. 2. Files that contain other information about the code, like a README file. 3. The version history for all of the files in the repository.</li>
